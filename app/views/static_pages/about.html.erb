    <p>The <strong>About Us</strong> page of your shop is vital because it’s where users go when first trying to determine a level of trust.  Since trust is such an important part of selling online, it’s a good idea to give people a fair amount information about yourself and your shop.  Here are a few things you should touch on:</p>
  <ul>
  	<li>Who you are</li>
  	<li>Why you sell the items you sell</li>
  	<li>Where you are located</li>
  	<li>How long you have been in business</li>
  	<li>How long you have been running your online shop</li>
  	<li>Who are the people on your team</li>
  </ul>
  <p>To edit this information you can go to the <a href="/admin/pages">Blogs &amp; Pages Tab</a> of the administration menu.</p>
